# Tier-A→Tier-B continuity
The four interaction primitives, dialog-first UX, and persistent annotations from DEC-V61-098 Tier-A are the substrate. M9 Tier-B does NOT modify the contract — it replaces the dogfood-only `force_uncertain` mock with a real classifier and lets the loop iterate until confident.

implementation_paths_step_1:
  - ui/frontend/src/pages/workbench/step_panel_shell/steps/Step3SetupBC.tsx (MODIFIED · envelope-mode opt-in via `?ai_mode=force_uncertain | force_blocked`; DialogPanel rendering; resume handler that PUTs face_annotations + re-runs envelope · landed at aa4d3f1)
  - ui/frontend/src/pages/workbench/step_panel_shell/__tests__/Step3SetupBC.test.tsx (4 new envelope-mode tests · 6 total)

implementation_paths_step_2_pending:
  - ui/backend/services/ai_actions/classifier/ (NEW package · arbitrary-STL geometric classifier · replaces the force_uncertain mock with real heuristics)
  - ui/backend/services/case_annotations/ (POSSIBLE EXTENSION · classifier may need helper utilities for face_id-based reasoning)
  - ui/backend/services/ai_actions/__init__.py (MODIFIED · setup_bc_with_annotations consults classifier when `force_uncertain` is unset; emits real UnresolvedQuestion list)
  - ui/backend/schemas/ai_action.py (POSSIBLE EXTENSION · richer Question metadata if classifier needs e.g. confidence-per-face scoring)
  - ui/backend/tests/test_ai_classifier.py (NEW · contract tests for the classifier — given fixture mesh, returns expected envelope shape)

prerequisite_status:
  v61_098_acceptance: Implementation Complete · Awaiting CFDJerry visual smoke (per dogfood guide) — Tier-B Step 1 builds ON TOP of Tier-A's 8 commits (d06d41d..0abdd74) which are pushed to origin and Codex-verified across 7 rounds. M9 Step 1 (this DEC) was CLASS-1 docs-only-OUTPUT-equivalent (frontend wiring of already-shipped backend); no new contract, no new persistent state. Step 2 will require V61-098 Accepted before backend changes (Kogami trigger evaluation may apply).
  break_freeze_quota: Tier-A consumes the FINAL §11.1 BREAK_FREEZE slot (3/3) per V61-098 frontmatter. M9 Step 1 lands UNDER the same quota slot since it's a layered extension of the Tier-A surface; no new quota required. M9 Step 2 (backend classifier) routes through normal feature freeze (post-Tier-A-Acceptance).

## §A · Why M9 Tier-B is the right next milestone

Per the long-horizon roadmap (commit 972fc4f), Era 1 LOOP SPINE has 6 milestones (M9-M14). M9 was named explicitly as **"Tier-B AI · face-pick selection + AI BC inference iteration"**. The roadmap framing positioned this as the milestone that productizes the pick→annotate→re-run loop into a complete iteration, not just a one-shot.

DEC-V61-098 Tier-A delivered the foundation:
- face_annotations.yaml persistent storage
- face_id stable hash
- AIActionEnvelope schema
- Backend `force_uncertain`/`force_blocked` flags for dogfood
- Frontend DialogPanel + AnnotationPanel + FacePickContext
- Step3SetupBC face-pick → AnnotationPanel save flow

M9 Tier-B closes the loop: the dialog substrate becomes real (not a mock), and engineers iterate with the AI until confident.

## §B · M9 Step 1 (LANDED at aa4d3f1)

**Scope**: Wire the existing DialogPanel into `[AI 处理]` envelope round-trip. Activate via `?ai_mode=force_uncertain` URL param.

**What works now**:
- Engineer navigates to `/workbench/<case-id>?step=3&ai_mode=force_uncertain`
- An "AI-COPILOT envelope mode" amber banner appears at the top of the right rail
- Click `[AI 处理]` → backend returns uncertain envelope with mock lid_orientation question
- DialogPanel renders below with the question
- Engineer clicks the lid face in the 3D viewport → pick routes to the lid_orientation question (NOT the AnnotationPanel)
- Click `[继续 AI 处理]` → backend `PUT /face-annotations` with the picked face_id (annotated_by='human', confidence='user_authoritative') → re-run envelope → returns confident → step completes

**What's still mocked**:
- `force_uncertain` query param. The backend always returns the same hardcoded `lid_orientation` question regardless of the actual mesh.

**Codex verdict**: APPROVE_WITH_COMMENTS. Two non-blocker observations:
1. Single-active-question pick routing is intentionally lossy under rapid double-picks (acceptable for force_uncertain dogfood; harden when classifier emits multi-question scenarios)
2. Stale envelope state on mid-session ai_mode toggle is a UX oddity, not a correctness problem

## §C · M9 Step 2 (PENDING — backend classifier)

The real arbitrary-STL classifier replaces `force_uncertain`. Open design questions:

| Question | Tentative answer |
|---|---|
| Where does the classifier live? | `ui/backend/services/ai_actions/classifier/` — new package, sibling to `ai_actions/__init__.py` |
| What's the classification surface? | `classify_setup_bc(case_dir, annotations) → AIActionEnvelope` |
| What heuristics? | Mesh-based: detect cube → confident LDC defaults · detect non-cube → uncertain (ask for inlet/outlet labels) · detect non-watertight → blocked. Additional heuristics: aspect ratio, principal axis alignment, face count distribution. |
| LLM-driven later? | Out of scope for Step 2. Step 3 (or M14 auto V&V) can integrate an LLM classifier on top of the geometric heuristics. |
| How does annotations.yaml feed back? | Classifier reads existing user_authoritative entries first; if all required questions are pinned, returns confident immediately. |

## §D · Step ordering

| Step | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Frontend envelope-mode wiring + DialogPanel integration | DONE (aa4d3f1, Codex APPROVE_WITH_COMMENTS) |
| 2 | Backend classifier (heuristic-only, no LLM) + replace force_uncertain default with real classification | PENDING — likely 5-8 commits, Codex pre-merge mandatory |
| 3 | Multi-question scenario hardening (lid + inlet + outlet at once) + pick-routing improvements per Codex Step 1 comments | PENDING — depends on Step 2 surfacing real multi-question payloads |
| 4 | Dogfood smoke + DEC closure | PENDING — CFDJerry validates with 2-3 real geometries |

## §E · Failure modes (what Step 2 Codex will key on)

| Class | Mode | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Classifier correctness | Heuristics misclassify a valid LDC cube as non-cube → blocks the dogfood path | Regression test: every existing LDC fixture must classify confident |
| Determinism | Non-deterministic classifier output across runs | Pure function of (mesh + annotations); no random seeds |
| Annotations feedback | Classifier ignores user_authoritative entries → infinite loop of "asking the same question" | Classifier MUST read annotations and treat user_authoritative as locked |
| API surface | Backend changes envelope shape and breaks Tier-A frontend | Pin existing AIActionEnvelope shape; only ADD optional fields if needed |

## §F · §11.1 BREAK_FREEZE accounting

DEC-V61-098 §F frontmatter consumed slot 3/3 of the §11.1 BREAK_FREEZE quota. M9 Tier-B Step 1 (aa4d3f1) is layered on top of that surface — no new persistent state, no new API contracts, no new components. Per the §11.1 advisory hook output that ran on commit aa4d3f1 ("§11.1 Workbench feature freeze · advisory ... Passed"), this commit was accepted as a within-quota extension.

M9 Step 2 (backend classifier) will introduce new persistent state (classifier package) and may shift the envelope contract. That goes through normal feature freeze evaluation; this DEC documents the routing intent so Step 2 doesn't surprise the freeze hook.

## §G · Self-pass-rate estimate

| Step | Self-estimate | Codex result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 80% | APPROVE_WITH_COMMENTS (matched — 2 non-blocker observations is exactly the band you'd expect for 80% confidence) |
| 2 | 50% | TBD — first real classifier always discovers issues; pre-merge Codex mandatory per RETRO-V61-001 ≤70% gate |

## §H · Notion sync plan

Sync this DEC after Step 1 review fully closed (already done — APPROVE_WITH_COMMENTS, no R2 needed). Step 2 will get its own Notion sync after closure. Cadence per project rule: every DEC syncs immediately after landing; this DEC syncs once Step 2 plan is firmer.
